# UNOFFICIAL Onshape Dark Theme
A dark theme for Onshape using Tampermonkey.
This theme is not officially supported by Onshape. Updates to onshape may make this script out of date. I plan to keep the script up to date, but it needs to be stated that Onshape is not responsible if I do not. 

Use of this script is in a gray area as far as Onshape terms and conditions are concerned. The simplest reading of the terms would indicate that use of this script is against the terms of service. Use at your own discretion.

The file is saved as CSS for text highlighting in editors, but it is javascript code for Tampermonkey. To install, simply copy the code into Tampermonkey and save as a new script.
