# Onshape-Dark-Theme
A dark theme for Onshape using Tampermonkey

The file is saved as CSS for text highlighting in editors, but it is javascript code for Tampermonkey.

It has been brought to my attention by a helpful user on the Onshape subreddit that this may be against Onshapes Terms of Use, section 4.b.i "You shall not ... alter ... the Software". Use at your own discretion.
